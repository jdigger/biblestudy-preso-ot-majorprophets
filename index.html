<section id="_what_is_a_prophet"><h2>What Is A Prophet?</h2><div class="slide-content"><div class="paragraph"><p>A prophet is one who announces or brings a message from God.</p></div></div></section>
<section id="_what_is_a_prophet_2"><h2>What Is A Prophet?</h2><div class="slide-content"><div class="paragraph"><p>The prophets taught and passionately reminded people of God&#8217;s Law and His Covenants (agreements) with His people. They pointed out sins and the consequences they would bring, calling on everyone to repent.</p></div></div></section>
<section id="_the_point_of_prophesy"><h2>The Point of Prophesy</h2><div class="slide-content"><div class="paragraph"><p>It&#8217;s not to give &#8220;secret&#8221; knowledge&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;of the future or anything else.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It is to motivate us to turn back to God and stay faithful. The major prophecies of destruction and punishment for the disobedient are coupled with the promises of God&#8217;s blessings for the obedient, and hope of the coming Kingdom of God.</p></div></div></section>

Above it stood seraphim; each one had six wings: with two he covered his face, with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. And one cried to another and said: &#8220;Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; The whole earth is full of His glory!&#8221; And the posts of the door were shaken by the voice of him who cried out, and the house was filled with smoke.</p></div></blockquote></div></div></section>
<section id="_isaiahs_calling_2"><div class="slide-content"><div class="quoteblock bible"><blockquote><div class="paragraph"><p>So I said: &#8220;Woe is me, for I am undone! Because I am a man of unclean lips, And I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; For my eyes have seen the King, The Lord of hosts.&#8221;</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a live coal which he had taken with the tongs from the altar. And he touched my mouth with it, and said: &#8220;Behold, this has touched your lips; Your iniquity is taken away, And your sin purged.&#8221;</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: &#8220;Whom shall I send, And who will go for Us?&#8221;</p></div></blockquote></div></div></section>
<section id="_isaiahs_calling_3"><div class="slide-content"><div class="quoteblock bible"><blockquote><div class="paragraph"><p>Then I said, &#8220;Here am I! Send me.&#8221;</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>And He said, &#8220;Go, and tell this people: Keep on hearing, but do not understand; Keep on seeing, but do not perceive.&#8221;</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>&#8220;Make the heart of this people dull, And their ears heavy, And shut their eyes; Lest they see with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their heart, And return and be healed.&#8221;</p></div></blockquote></div></div></section>
<section id="_the_purpose_of_prophecy"><h2>The Purpose of Prophecy</h2><div class="slide-content"><div class="quoteblock bible"><blockquote><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+1%3A19-21&amp;version=NIV">2 Peter 1:19-21</a> We also have the prophetic message as something completely reliable, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet&#8217;s own interpretation of things. For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.</blockquote></div></div></section>

<section id="_isaiah"><h2>Isaiah</h2><div class="slide-content"><div class="paragraph"><p>His name means &#8220;Yahweh is Salvation&#8221;, and it&#8217;s the clear theme of his book.</p></div></div></section>
<section id="_isaiah_the_man"><h2>Isaiah - The Man</h2><div class="slide-content"><div class="paragraph"><p>He lived around the years 740-680 B.C. (during 2Kings/2Chronicles).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>He was evidently a well-educated student of international affairs, and spent most of his time in the city of Jerusalem, where he rubbed shoulders with royalty and gave advice on foreign affairs. (He was likely King Uzziah&#8217;s cousin.)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>He vigorously opposed any entangling alliances with foreign powers. As warned by the Lord in chapter six, his cause was doomed to failure. Both the government and people chose to put their trust in the political alliances of man, rather than in the sure promises of God.</p></div></div></section>
<section id="_isaiah_a_mini_bible"><h2>Isaiah - A Mini-Bible</h2><div class="slide-content"><div class="paragraph"><p>The first thirty-nine chapters of Isaiah largely correspond to the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament, which largely anticipate the coming of Messiah. The last twenty-seven chapters of Isaiah neatly parallel the twenty-seven chapters of the New Testament, speaking a great deal about Messiah and His Kingdom as the Servant of the Lord.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Chapters 1-39 speak of man&#8217;s great need of Salvation, while chapters 40-66 reveal God&#8217;s provision of Salvation in Messiah and His kingdom.</p></div></div></section>

<div class="quoteblock bible"><blockquote><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+9%3A6-7&amp;version=NKJV">Isaiah 9:6-7</a> For unto us a Child is born, Unto us a Son is given; And the government will be upon His shoulder. And His name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of His government and peace There will be no end,
Upon the throne of David and over His kingdom, To order it and establish it with judgment and justice From that time forward, even forever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.</blockquote></div></div></section>
<section id="_isaiah_the_easter_prophet"><h2>Isaiah - The Easter Prophet</h2><div class="slide-content"><div class="quoteblock bible"><blockquote><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+53%3A4-7&amp;version=NKJV">Isaiah 53:4-7</a> Surely He has borne our griefs And carried our sorrows; Yet we esteemed Him stricken, Smitten by God, and afflicted. But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; The chastisement for our peace was upon Him, And by His stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; We have turned, every one, to his own way; And the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed and He was afflicted, Yet He opened not His mouth; He was led as a lamb to the slaughter, And as a sheep before its shearers is silent, So He opened not His mouth.</blockquote></div></div></section>

How you are cut down to the ground, You who weakened the nations! For you have said in your heart: &#8220;I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will also sit on the mount of the congregation On the farthest sides of the north; I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the Most High.&#8221; Yet you shall be brought down to Sheol, To the lowest depths of the Pit.</blockquote></div></div></section>

<section id="_jeremiah_the_man"><h2>Jeremiah - The Man</h2><div class="slide-content"><div class="paragraph"><p>Jeremiah was a contemporary of Zephaniah, Habakkuk, Daniel, and Ezekiel.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>His prophetic ministry began in 626 B.C. and ended sometime after 586. Ezekiel began his ministry in Babylon in 593, he was also a late contemporary of this great prophet in Jerusalem.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>He was friends with Josiah, who was a faithful king, but that only lasted a few years before the kings that followed led the nation deeper and deeper into heresy.</p></div></div></section>
<section id="_jeremiahs_reputation"><h2>Jeremiah&#8217;s Reputation</h2><div class="slide-content"><div class="paragraph"><p>He&#8217;s often thought of as &#8220;the weeping prophet,&#8221; and for good reason. He prayed desperately for his people, who continued to go further and further from God, forcing Him to have them be exiled by the emerging Babylonian empire. Despite the discipline the Lord would bring upon them, ultimately Jeremiah preached a message of hope that the people of Judah did not want to hear&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;yet.</p></div></div></section>

They have set up their detestable idols in the house that bears my Name and have defiled it. They have built the high places of Topheth in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to burn their sons and daughters in the fire&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;something I did not command, nor did it enter my mind.</blockquote></div></div></section>

Then the carcasses of this people will become food for the birds and the wild animals, and there will be no one to frighten them away. I will bring an end to the sounds of joy and gladness and to the voices of bride and bridegroom in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, for the land will become desolate.</blockquote></div></div></section>

(Psalms, being a hymnal rather than a &#8220;book,&#8221; doesn&#8217;t count.) It warns against the destruction of Jerusalem.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Lamentations is five poems written after Jerusalem is destroyed, reflecting both the obvious cries of anguish, as well as holding onto God&#8217;s promises of future mercy.</p></div></div></section>

You must go to everyone I send you to and say whatever I command you. Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you and will rescue you,&#8221; declares the Lord. Then the Lord reached out his hand and touched my mouth and said to me, &#8220;I have put my words in your mouth.
